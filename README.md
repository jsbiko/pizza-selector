####

My Pizza Place is an order page built in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap and jQuery. In this project, I have created a landing page for my pizza franchise where walk-in customers can place their orders in their preference based on what's available and choose a way they want it delivered. They can opt to consume their pizza at the store front or have it delivered to a location or even place the order and pick-up at an option of their choice.
